# Minesweeper-code

This is just the old-school windows minesweeper that I made using python and pygame.
I also made all the images for the numbers and tiles and mines using pixilart.com.

If you want to see it working just extract the img file and run the main. Don't mind the broken clock or the ugly game over and win screens.
Left click to reveal tiles right click to flag them.
